If you want to try it out, clone this repository and assign name of the file-you-want-to-perform-detection-on to image_name variable, and then simply run the script. Enjoy. Or not. I don't know.

Function four_point_transform used for image transformation (from transform.py) was taken from Adrian Rosebrock's imutils library: https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils. Check out his website (http://www.pyimagesearch.com), his work is awesome and it really helped me out writing this script!
